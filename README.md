Please use Rails to build a simple survey tool, with the following requirements:



  A user should be able to create any number of surveys



  A survey consists of one question represented as a single string. The answer to the question is always Yes or No.



  The home screen of your app should show a list of surveys and a button to create a new one



  You don't need to worry about user authentication but you may stub this out if you wish



  A user can respond to a survey by clicking into it from the list mentioned above



  A survey can be answered multiple times with a yes/no response



  You should keep track of when each of the survey responses are saved



  You should display the results of the survey on the home screen with the percentage of yes and no responses.



  You should make sure that your app can be run by other developers on the team.



  Make sure all of your dependencies are listed in your Gemfile and instructions are provided for setup if needed.



  You should use SQLite to persist your data.



  You should use ruby 2.7.2



  You should use Rails 6.0





You should return back to us a single compressed file that contains the source for this Rails app.
